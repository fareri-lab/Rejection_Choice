Research Purpose

The goal of this study is to begin to better characterize how our value of choice and decision-making is affected by social contexts. 



Description of the Research

You will be asked to take part in a computerized task in which the photographs you include and upload as part of your participation in the study will be shared with an anonymous partner(s). You will receive feedback from your partner(s) after your photos are shown. The feedback may come in the form of liked or disliked. Any photos submitted to the study will be immediately discarded upon completion of the study. You will then be given the option to make a series of choices in a lottery game or decline and have the computer participate in the task on your behalf. You will also be asked to complete a series of self-report questionnaires which may ask about your social experiences, personality and substance use either at the beginning or end of the session. The study will be broken up into two parts: in the first, you will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires and upload a series of photos off of your Instagram account; in the second part, you will complete a computerized task and post-task questionnaires.



Your participation in each part of this study will last between 40 minutes and 1.5 hours, depending on how quickly you complete the tasks.



Potential Risks

There are no known risks associated with your participation in this study.  You may experience mild discomfort from performing a computer task for up to one hour (i.e., strained eyes); however, there will be rest periods during the course of the experimental session to mediate any discomfort of this sort. You are able to withdraw from participation at any time if you feel any discomfort at all without penalty to you. 



Potential Benefits

There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this study.  Your participation will help us

understand how we are affected by different social contexts and how this may influence subsequent decisions. The findings from this set of studies may be helpful in understanding how social influence can have both positive and negative effects on our behavior, as well as our emotional and mental well-being.



Costs/Compensation

You will receive compensation for your participation in this study in the form of monetary compensation at the rate specified when you entered into the survey online on Prolific (e.g., between $5-$10 per hour).  You may also be eligible for bonus pay based on your choices and successfully completing the task.
